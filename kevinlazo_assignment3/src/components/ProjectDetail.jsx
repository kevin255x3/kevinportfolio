Essentially, we wanted to capture the people attending the UBC Shop Local Event, there were many vintage consignors, what surprised me was the large turnoutand sense of community we felt when we were there! Many of the students were enthusiastic and wanted to show off their outfits, which we were able to capture in this project with their consent. This was only the first day, however to generate awareness that we would be attending the second day we quickly edited and uploaded the retrospective of day one to social media which created more attention going into day 2.",

Just like day one, we were able to capture the energy of the day, and the sense of community that was there! Day two was just as fun as day one if not more. With our day one being viewed, even more students wanted to make an appearance in the video, volunteering to show off their outfits. A local brand called OUTLAWS made an appearance and we were able to screenprint t-shirts and recieved a discount on any of our purchases with them. I met many need people and look forward to another event where we are all able to express our interest in fashion as well as the creative work surrounding it.",

      retrospective: "This was our first event at UBC, and our first attempt doing video content for the vintage page. What was really cool about this experience was that we ended up enjoying the process and actually did it again in the future. We built on the hype we created from the day one video and went even harder on our second video. Our efforts were recognized and the video did well on instagram reels. This would eventually be an opportunity for us to promote future appearances in different markets around Vancouver.",

However, the team, models, and photographers were so much fun to work with that I was able to learn a lot from them. I immediately felt at ease. This was also fun in the sense that since my last effort in post production and video storytelling I have learned new techniques in motion graphics and wardrobe styling. We ended up covering alot, and capturing alot of footage, photos and highlights of the day. We ended up with a full length video prepared before the event which was uploaded onto social media. A full photogallery shot by Kiana. This was so much fun, i'm looking forward to working with them again!",
